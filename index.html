	<h2 class="titletop"> About Yuan and her hometown </h2>
		<p>
		I was born in China, a country with 1.3 billion people. 
		Nearly one hundred million of them are from Henan Province, the most populous among the 34 provinces. 
		My hometown Zhengzhou is the capital city of Henan Province, China. 
		About 8 million people live in Zhengzhou, which in my opinion is just too many for a medium-sized city. 
		Every weekend when my family and I shopped in the supermarket nearby, it felt like black Friday. 
		Every time I tried to catch a bus during rush hour, it was like a fighting game. 
		When I came to Iowa City, I found that the city buses are almost empty compared to back home.
		</p>

		<p>
		Another problem caused by the large population is attending college. 
		To be admitted by universities countrywide, all the high school graduates need to take a college entrance exam which is held once a year. 
		It is not easy, and it is not fair. More than nine million students took the entrance exam last year, and 800,000 are from Henan Province. 
		However, good colleges are all in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. 
		To compete with students from Beijing and Shanghai, we need to score 200 points higher to be admitted by our ideal colleges. 
		Because of the intense competition, the entire goal for the high school education in my hometown was to get us students prepared for the most important exam in our lives. 
		Most Chinese students find the senior year of high school miserable. We took practice exams every day. 
		Teachers only care about our scores, not if we actually learned something. 
		I don't like studying that way, so I chose to skip the Chinese College Entrance Exam and went to Hong Kong to take the ACT and SAT exams and applied to universities in the United States.
		</p>

		Despite the large population, Henan Province has a long and brilliant history. 
		Among the eight ancient capital cities throughout China's 5000-year history, four of them are in Henan. 
		Henan Province is also the birthplace of Chinese Kung Fu. 
		There is a stereotype that some people may think all Chinese are good at table tennis and they are all Kung Fu masters. 
		Actually, I studied and practiced table tennis for a year and Taekwondo for a semester. After I saw the movie Leap Man which tells the story of Bruce Lee's master, I went to learn the traditional Chinese martial art called Wing Chun Fist. 
		However, I'm not an expert. I have no enough strength, so I just tried to make the moves look beautiful. My master said I was like dancing not boxing.
